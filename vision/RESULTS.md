# Preliminary results: staged → real fall detection

**Run:** Colab, NVIDIA L4. Encoders: CLIP ViT-L-14 (datacomp_xl_s13b_b90k) and VideoMAE-B (Kinetics-400).
**Labels:** one labeller, the first 150 videos of the random test sample (presented in random order, so this is a random subset of the 422-video test sample). No training-pool clips labelled yet, so real-trained probes were not run.
**Counts:** staged (UR Fall) 316 clips / 60 falls. Real (OOPS!) test set 231 clips from 149 videos / 96 falls.

AUROC, average precision (AP) and recall at 5% false-positive rate, each with a 95% video-level bootstrap CI.

| staged (5-fold CV) | probe: CLIP + VideoMAE | 1.000 [1.000, 1.000] | 1.000 [1.000, 1.000] | 1.000 [1.000, 1.000] |
| **real** | zero-shot CLIP | 0.718 [0.652, 0.780] | 0.592 [0.506, 0.696] | 0.062 [0.022, 0.242] |

| **real** | staged-trained: VideoMAE | 0.773 [0.712, 0.829] | 0.720 [0.639, 0.798] | 0.302 [0.147, 0.489] |
| **real** | staged-trained: CLIP + VideoMAE | 0.783 [0.717, 0.837] | 0.718 [0.625, 0.802] | 0.219 [0.101, 0.500] |

## What this shows
- **Large staged-to-real gap.** Every probe is at or near perfect on staged data (AUROC ≥ 0.998, recall 100% at 5% FPR). On real falls the best reaches AUROC 0.78 and catches at most ~30% of falls at 5% FPR, and that method's 95% interval tops out at 0.49.
- **Motion-aware representations trend better** (CLIP appearance 0.733 → CLIP temporal 0.751 → VideoMAE 0.773). The intervals overlap, so the ordering is not established at n = 149 videos.
- **UR Fall is saturated.** A perfect in-domain score means it cannot rank methods; harder staged datasets are needed.

## Not yet measured
- Real-trained and staged+real probes (need labelled training-pool clips). This decides whether the gap comes from training on staged data or from real falls being intrinsically hard.
- Falls vs. other accidents only (`real_hard` rows, added after this run).
- Second-labeller agreement (Cohen's κ).
